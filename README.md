# Smart-Walking-Stick-for-the-Visually-Impaired

The Smart Walking Stick for the Visually Impaired is an advanced technological solution specifically designed to enhance mobility and safety for individuals with visual impairments. This innovative walking stick incorporates an ultrasonic sensor that provides real-time information on proximity to obstacles, enabling users to navigate their surroundings more confidently. By utilizing audio and tactile feedback, such as a buzzer and vibrations, the walking stick significantly improves the navigation experience for visually impaired individuals. Additionally, in situations where the user may lose their way, the walking stick is equipped with a button that, when pressed, sends their location to their loved ones via SMS.

# Features
1. Obstacle Detection: The walking stick utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles in the user's path and provides real-time information on their proximity.
2. Proximity Warning: When the user approaches an obstacle, the walking stick emits an audible alert, such as a buzzer, to warn them.
3. Tactile Feedback: In addition to the audible alert, the walking stick provides tactile feedback through vibrations to assist the user in perceiving obstacles.
4. Real-time Proximity Information: The walking stick continuously monitors the distance to nearby obstacles and relays instant feedback to the user.
5. Location Sharing via SMS: The walking stick includes a button that, when pressed, triggers the sending of the user's location to their designated loved ones via SMS.
6. Enhanced Safety: By providing real-time obstacle detection and location sharing capabilities, the walking stick enhances safety and offers peace of mind to visually impaired individuals and their loved ones.
